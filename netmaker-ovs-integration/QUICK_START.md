# GhostBridge Quick Start - Context Handoff

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

### **Phase-Based Installation:**
```bash
# Phase 1: Network foundation with ifup/ifdown integration
sudo ./scripts/01-network-setup.sh

# Phase 2: Container creation with network dependencies  
sudo ./scripts/02-container-create.sh

# Phase 3-5: (Need to be created)
# 03-mqtt-install.sh - MQTT with readiness checks
# 04-netmaker-install.sh - Netmaker with MQTT dependency
# 05-proxy-setup.sh - Nginx/direct routing based on IP mode
```

## 🏠 Home Server Testing
- Set environment variables for dual IP
- Test on home server before production
- Validates network timing and ifup hooks

## 🔑 Key Features Built
- **Interface monitoring** (60sec timeout like original)
- **ifup/ifdown hooks** for proper timing
- **Network readiness scripts** 
- **Dual IP support** ready
- **Proper install sequencing**

## 📁 Current Status
- Phase 1 & 2 complete with dependency checking
- Need phases 3-5 to complete deployment
- Ready for home server testing

## 🎯 Next Context Tasks
1. Complete remaining phases (03-05)
2. Test on home server with dual IP
3. Debug any timing/network issues
4. Prepare for production deployment
